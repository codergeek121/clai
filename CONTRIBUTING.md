# Contributing

The following topics are missing for a 1.0.0 release:

```
* Allow adding "personas" to the config ([see here](docs/personas.md))
* Rewrite with tests as soon as the basic prototype is useful
* Add GitHub Actions for PRs
* Build a landing page
```

Please use `clai` and contribute here on GitHub. I'm open to all suggestions and improvements.

0.x.x versions don't need tests or extensive documentation. Adding a small description will help me understand your change though :)

Please open a PR with a short description of your use-case and I will review and merge.

Thank you,
Niklas
