# Introduction

You can think of `clai` as ChatGPT for the terminal.
It's very basic at the moment. I'm currently trying to incorporate clai in my daily work, so I'm still experimenting with the API.

`clai` currently supports OpenAI and needs a paid API key to work.

My main use case currently is to have a terminal permanently opened with a clai session and ask questions instead of googling.

0.x.0 will be unstable and untested, I'm currently aiming to release a tested 1.0.0 soon. Please see [here](https://github.com/codergeek121/clai/CONTRIBUTING.MD) on how to contribute at the current stage of the project.
