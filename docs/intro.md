# Introduction

You can think of `clai` as ChatGPT for the terminal.
It's very basic at the moment. You can think of it as ChatGPT for the terminal. I'm currently trying to incorporate clai in my daily work, so I'm still experimenting with the API.

`clai` currently supports OpenAI and needs a paid API key to work.

My main use case currently is to have a terminal opened with a clai session and ask questions instead of googling.

0.x.0 will be unstable and untested, I'm currently aiming to release a tested 1.0.0 soon. Please see [here](https://github.com/codergeek121/clai/CONTRIBUTING.MD) on how to contribute at this stage of the project.
